Anagrams

Return true or false depends on provided strings are anagrams of eachother.
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a 
different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly
once. One string is an anagram of another if it uses the same characters
in the same quantity. Only consider characters, not spaces
or punctuation. Consider capital letters to be the same as lower case.

Examples:
anagrams('rail safety', 'fairy tales') === true
anagrams('RAIL! SAFETY!', 'fairy tales') === true
anagrams('Hi there', 'Bye there') === false
